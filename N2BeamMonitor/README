 B- USER INTERFACES

   The user command interface is set via the G4UIExecutive class
   in the main() function in N2BeamMonitor.cc

 C- HOW TO RUN

    - Execute N2BeamMonitor in the 'interactive mode' with visualization:
        % ./N2BeamMonitor
      and type in the commands from run1.mac line by line:
        Idle> /control/verbose 2
        Idle> /tracking/verbose 1
        Idle> /run/beamOn 10
        Idle> ...
        Idle> exit
      or
        Idle> /control/execute run1.mac
        ....
        Idle> exit

    - Execute N2BeamMonitor  in the 'batch' mode from macro files
      (without visualization)
        % ./N2BeamMonitor run2.mac
        % ./N2BeamMonitor N2BeamMonitor.in > N2BeamMonitor.out
